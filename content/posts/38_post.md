This is what I gathered from an amazinf video of the same name from CodeAesthetic. Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf7vDBBOBUA).

1. First principle is describing the variables so well that you don't need comments. Your code should actually read like English, it should be that easy to read.
2. Types can make comments redundant. [This is more specific to C++ and is little more complicated in other languages].
3. Why hate comments? Because when people update code, they usually fail to update the comments.
4. Write high quality code documentation instead! Keep it as close to the code as possible.
5. However, don't be so rigid on not using comments. You can use it when things are too complicated.
