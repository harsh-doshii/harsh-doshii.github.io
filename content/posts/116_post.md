In a few years, I believe the software engineering Q&A space will be entirely dominated by AI tools like ChatGPT. While AI has undeniable advantages—iterative, conversational, and capable of elaborating or course-correcting in real-time, it also introduces a unique challenge. Engineers may find themselves seeking purely human-written sources for their authenticity and reliability.

The main strength of AI tools lies in their ability to simulate a conversation, making it easier for users to ask follow-up questions and resolve doubts interactively. On the other hand, human-written blogs and tutorials tend to be more trustworthy and accurate from the get-go, thanks to the author’s expertise and attention to detail.

This got me thinking: why not combine the best of both worlds? Imagine a tutorial platform where the core content—blogs, tutorials, or articles—is created entirely by humans, preserving their authenticity and depth. Then, embedded on the same page, an AI-powered chatbot (trained on the context of that specific blog or tutorial) is available for readers. If a reader gets stuck or has questions, they can seamlessly interact with the chatbot to clarify doubts, dive deeper into specific topics, or explore related concepts without leaving the page.

The concept doesn’t need to stop at tutorials. It could work for any text-based resource—documentation. Here's how I envision it:

A Google Chrome extension that, when activated, parses the HTML of any webpage, extracts and cleans the main body of text, and feeds it into the context of an AI like ChatGPT.
The extension adds a floating dialogue box to the page, enabling users to have a conversation with the AI about the content they’re currently reading. This will be a solid partnership of humans and machines!
