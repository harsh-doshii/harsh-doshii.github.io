1. Docker run vs Docker exec:
Docker run is typically used for images. This command is used when you want to spin up a container from an image. Let's say you want to go inside the terminal of a docker container that you want to spin from the image, the command that is used is like this:
`docker run -it <image-name> bash`

Docker exec is used for containers. Let's say we already have a container that is running and we want to enter it's bash (just like the case highlighted above), we can run the command:
`docker exec -it <container-name> bash`

2. Entrypoint and commands are two important concepts in Docker. Quoting a stack overflow explaination for the same:
a. Docker has a default entrypoint but it does not have a default command. The default entrypoint is `/bin/sh -c`. Commands on the other hand, need to be passed. Everything after the image name in `docker run -it <image-name>` is a command, which is run via the entrypoint. The CMD mentioned in the dockerfile also act like commands which you don't have to explicitly pass when running `docker run`
b. When you run the command `docker run -it <image-name> bash`. The command is run via the entrypoint. i.e., the actual thing that gets executed is `/bin/sh -c bash`.
c. Entrypoint can be customised using --entrypoint flag

3. Container names generated by default can be weird and confusing, so it is a good practice to name the containers that are being spun up with --name flag. 
E.g.: `docker run --name <container-name-that-you-want> -it <image-name>`
