This blog will have frequent edits. It is a live, breathing blog. This will be my place to store my whackiest project ideas. I want to write at least 10 ideas. It is more of introspection more than anything.

1. I use spreadsheets a lot to track my work, my personal life and things like that. Think how can this process of logging be improved? Difficulties I face:
a. Coming up with an ideal template to begin with.
b. Forgetting to update the log. Do reminders help? Not really. A spreadsheet + alarm that works would be a good combo.

Maybe maybe an AI bot that revises your entire day before and then it sends you a summary of the notification, this will prompt you to update the log again.
