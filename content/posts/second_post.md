Hi all, today I learnt about the difference between json dumps and json loads functions in python.

json dumps: 
it takes a json object (dictionary) ---> string
(imagine it this way, dumps is basically removal of something right? so json dumps is removal from json)

json loads:
it takes a string ---> json object (dictionary)
