Today was the first time I used k9s. I wanted to check the logs generated in a container inside a pod, so my senior engineer recommended that I use k9s. I was so damn impressed after I ran k9s in the terminal!

A very fancy terminal with logo of k9s opened up inside my terminal. I could easily switch between namespaces, inside each namespace I could easily switch between pods and inside each pod I could easily swich between containers.
My main task today was to get the logs, just pressing "L" on the container I wanted gave me all that I ever needed!
Also pressing "D" on pods for which you want describe was awesome!

Along with easy navigation, there are so many commands that can be used. I am yet to explore a lot. k9s is an amazing productivity tool imo, the UI will really speed up k8s management
