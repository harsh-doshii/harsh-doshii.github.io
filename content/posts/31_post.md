The nature of my work requires me to do devops stuff as well and YAML is an integral part of it. I would rather say, I have had more PRs in YAML than in any other coding language. YAML is a fairly easy, human-readable data-serialization language. I have used it extensively for configurations of pipelines, dockerfiles, aws-environments, etc. Let's go over what makes a YAML file.

1. Key-Value Pairs:

fruit: apple

dessert: "apple pie"

In case that there is a whitespace in the value, wrap it up inside inverted commas.


2. Arrays/Lists:

Each Key has multiple Values:

`Drinks:
    - Smoothie
    - Water
`
