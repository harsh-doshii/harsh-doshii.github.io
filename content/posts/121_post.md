We have been querying Database since forever, but can we query through a codebase? Yes we can through CodeQL now. CodeQL stands for Code Query Language.

Wait, how is searching through a codebase, through simple text search in IDE different from querying?
Searching through a codebase using an IDE's search functionality and querying with CodeQL serve different purposes and have different capabilities.

Most IDEs provide basic and advanced search capabilities, such as: Keyword search, Regex, Finding References to locate function or variable usages, etc. However, these searches are mostly syntacticâ€”they work by finding literal text matches or simple patterns but do not analyze code semantics (i.e., meaning, relationships, or data flow).

On the other hand, CodeQL is a powerful static analysis tool that allows you to query a codebase semantically rather than just searching for text patterns. It:

1. Understands code structure: It builds an internal database (abstract syntax tree, control flow graph, etc.), so you can query program elements meaningfully.
2. Finds security vulnerabilities: You can write queries to detect SQL injections, hardcoded secrets, and memory leaks, which are impossible with simple text searches.
3. Analyzes relationships: Queries can track function calls, variable flows, inheritance, and data propagation.
4. Cross-file & cross-repository analysis: Unlike IDE searches, which are often limited to a single repository, CodeQL can analyze entire projects or organizations.

CodeQL analysis consists of three steps:

1. Preparing the code, by creating a CodeQL database. (Basically convert the code --> representation of code in terms of AST, Graphs, etc.)
2. Running CodeQL queries against the database.
3. Interpreting the query results.

Footnote:

Difference between Syntax and Semantics:

- Syntax is about the language laws, rules. It is basically "TAX". For eg, missing a `;` at the end of a C++ statement, is a syntactical error. "I goed to play." is a syntax mistake because it violates the rules of grammar.
- Semantics is about the logic and meaning. Remember it as "seMEANtics". For eg, dividing by 0 is a semantic error as it is illogical. "The chair ate the apple" is syntactically correct but semantically incorrect as it makes no sense.
