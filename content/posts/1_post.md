Hello world, finally a blog of my own! I will use this space to write about everything new that I learn in the world of Computer Science. It can be as small as writing "Hello World" in a language that I have never tried before or as huge as writing my own parser-compiler. It is going to be a fun ride full of learnings, an I am glad to have you with me!
