title = "39. Functions vs Classes: When to use what"

Functions are action focused. They are bits that simply manipulate an input into a desired output.
Object-Oriented are state focused. It is more about structuring, you can group variables, use inheritance, etc. etc. Objects represent the state and methods manipulate those.

So:
action focused --> functional script
state focused --> use classes

You will get to know better about the differences between the both by reading and writing more code.
