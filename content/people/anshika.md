Everyone should have a Maithil in their lives. He is that dependable friend that only wants the best for you and everyone around him. He is super smart, and has a Midas touch if I may, everything he touches turns to golf. I met Maithil in one of our school trips back in 8th grade, from that point onwards we became the best of friends.

Maithil is a freaking all-rounder. Everything that you can do, he can and will do it better. More than his stunning SWE career, Maithil's journey has been of love and friendships. He will go at any length to make things work.
