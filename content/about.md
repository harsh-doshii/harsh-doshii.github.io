Hello! I am Harsh Doshi.

I am joining University of Pennsylvania in Fall 2025 to pursue my Masters in Computer Science. I worked as a Software Engineer at Salesforce, Inc. for 2 years, and before that I did my undergrad in CS from BITS Pilani Goa Campus.

At Salesforce, I worked in the domain of software security - threat and vulnerability management. I scanned vulnerabilities and bugs for breakfast. Deploed defenders for lunch. Monitored health of systems and services for Dinner and had a good night sleep knowing that Salesforce assets are secured to the highest level.

This website is my personal journal, a repository of my daily insights and discoveries as I relentlessly strive to level up as a software engineer. Expect these blog posts to be raw, unpolishedâ€”more like my short notes, capturing moments of my continuous learning journey. Also, a crazier way to think about this is that this webpage is my immoratility, I won't be there some day, but this page will continue to exist.

Life goals: 
1. Keep learning continuously
2. Be a high agency person
3. Make people around me happier, all the time!
