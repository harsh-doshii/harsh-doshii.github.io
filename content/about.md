Hello! I am Harsh Doshi.

I recently finished my CS Undergrad from BITS Pilani Goa Campus and now am working as an Software Engineer at Salesforce, Inc. 

At Salesforce, I am in the domain of security - threat and vulnerability management. I scan vulnerabilities and bugs for breakfast. Deploy defenders for lunch. Monitor health of systems and services for Dinner. I have a good night sleep knowing that Salesforce assets are secured to the highest level.
