Hello! I am Harsh Doshi.

I recently finished my CS Undergrad from BITS Pilani Goa Campus and am now working as a Software Engineer at Salesforce, Inc.

At Salesforce, I work in the domain of software security - threat and vulnerability management. I scan vulnerabilities and bugs for breakfast. Deploy defenders for lunch. Monitor health of systems and services for Dinner and have a good night sleep knowing that Salesforce assets are secured to the highest level.

This website is my personal journal, a repository of my daily insights and discoveries as I relentlessly strive to level up as a software engineer. Expect these blog posts to be raw, unpolishedâ€”more like my short notes, capturing moments of my continuous learning journey. Also, a crazier way to think about this is that this webpage is my immoratility, I won't be there some day. but this page will continue to exist.
